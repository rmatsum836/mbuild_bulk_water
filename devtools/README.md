# Testing and continuous integration tools

This directory contains files for running Continuous Integration (CI).

mBuild and foyer uses TravisCI and Microsoft Azure for continuous integration.
mBuild recipes should also use these services to ensure that the code is adequately tested.
* `travis-ci`: Linux and OSX testing through [Travis-CI](https://about.travis-ci.com/) 
* `azure`: Coming soon
